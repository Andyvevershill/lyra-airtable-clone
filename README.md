##  Important info

I have built this demo in ≈ three weeks so it's important to understand the functional limitations outlined below:

1. You can only enter with Google Log In.
2. Once inside the dashbaord: => create => "Build an app on your own", creates a new base and a default view.
3. After creating your first base, the dashboard will show all created bases ordered by last accesssed, where you can customise, favourite, rename.
4. Bases will be created with a default table, with default data (faker.js), and a default view.
5. Columns => there are only 3 types of columns: text, number and checkbox. Any standard field in the dropdown with "number" in its title with be created as number type, and so on for text + checkbox. No other column types can be created.
6. Functionality => Filtering, sorting and searching are implimented through the backend for scalability of large datasets.
7. Views => fully functional: rename, change active, duplicate, delete. Any changes to filtering/sorting/hidden fields, will automatically be saved to the view and preloaded into the table when reselecting this view.

Thats it... Create as many Bases, Tables and Views as you like.
